                    By purchasing SOLCH, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the Company and its respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of SOLCH, including losses associated with the terms set forth below. <br /><br />
                    Prior to purchasing SOLCH, you should carefully consider the terms listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the following terms are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase SOLCH. <br /><br />
                    Purchases of SOLCH should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should have a functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the Company will be available to assist purchasers of SOLCH during the sale, it will not be responsible in any way for loss of any funds or crypto assets, including SOLCH, that result from actions taken by, or omitted by purchasers. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase SOLCH or participate in the sale of SOLCH. Your participation in SOLCH sale is deemed to be your undertaking that you satisfy the requirements mentioned in this paragraph.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">1 - SOLCH Sale and Service Description</p>
                <p>
                    The SOLCH Token Offering represents a voluntary contribution towards the implementation of crypto services in the ecosystem. These Services, the Token Offering and the usage of SOLCH are described in the Whitepaper (or as stated on the website). For the redemption of SOLCH for Services as well as for the usage of these Terms & Conditions apply (as stated on the website and after availability of the Services in the relevant locations in the ecosystem). The website (and the Whitepaper) and any other present or future are herein jointly referred to as the “Accompanying Documents”. <br /><br />
                    The SOLCH Token does not grant equity stake nor profit sharing. It does not represent an ownership right or direct claim in the SOLCH Ecosystem, revenues, profits or intellectual property, either present or future. Despite SOLCH team’s best efforts and diligence to bring this project forward, all Participants should be aware that their contributions are not refundable and accept the inherent risk (as outlined below) of project failure at any stage of development. This implicit risk is associated with any and all uncertainty of backing technologically-focused entrepreneurial projects, and can be affected by either internal or external factors that are out of the control scope of SOLCH. Additionally, Participants may be subject to any applicable compliance regulations (including KYC, AML and others where applicable). <br /><br />
                    SOLCH can be used in the Ecosystem with a corresponding utility value and will not provide any redemption rights. We believe that SOLCH do not qualify as a security or any other form of capital investment product and do not provide a Participant equity share in the legal structure of SOLCH. <br /><br />
                    <span className="text-red text-opacity-95">SOLCH can only be used for purchases within the SOLCH Ecosystem and will not be accepted by any third party. Hence, SOLCH do not represent any unit of account or virtual currency.</span> <br /><br />
                    SOLCH offers cryptocurrencies as method of payment. SOLCH may require a minimum or maximum amount for individual payment methods to manage payment costs and risks. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">2 - Scope of Terms</p>
                <p>
                    <span className="text-red text-opacity-95">Unless otherwise stated herein, these T&Cs only govern your purchase of SOLCH from SolanaCash during the Pre-Sale and Main Sale as defined in the Whitepaper.</span> <br /><br />
                    Any use of SOLCH in connection with providing or receiving Services on the Ecosystem may be governed by other applicable terms and conditions and policies.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">3 - Participation requirements</p>
                <p>
                    If you want to buy SOLCH with cryptocurrencies, you can send your Token units from any major cryptocurrency wallet, or you can buy with FIAT, following the instructions on the platform. <br /><br />
                    During the sale process you will be prompted to insert a new address of a Solana standard compatible wallet, as provided on the website, in order to receive any Tokens, you purchase from us. We reserve the right to prescribe additional guidance regarding specific wallet requirements. Please follow the website details carefully. <br /><br />
                    You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing your wallet, vault, or other storage mechanism you use to receive and hold SOLCH purchased from us, including any requisite private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your Tokens. We are not responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses relating to lost access credentials. <br /><br />
                    We may determine, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable laws (e.g. KYC/AML) or regulations in connection with selling SOLCH to you. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request and acknowledge that we may refuse to sell SOLCH to you until you provide such requested information and we have determined that it is permissible to sell you SOLCH under applicable laws or regulations.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">4 - Cancellation: Refusal of Purchase Requests / Refunds</p>
                <p>
                    All purchases of SOLCH from us during the Pre-Sale and Main Sale are final, and there are no refunds or cancellations except as set forth herein or as may be required by applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel SOLCH purchase requests at any time in our sole discretion. <br /><br />
                    SOLCH may pause the SOLCH sale during the Pre-Sale or Main Sale periods in our sole discretion. Reasons for such a pause among others can be: material increase in Bitcoin or Solana blockchain price volatility (e.g. Bitcoin price crash), news that might impact the price volatility, suspicion of systematic fraud when purchasing SOLCH, or significant higher load of IT systems than expected.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">5 - Possible Migration of Tokens</p>
                <p>
                    SOLCH is being created as a Solana blockchain compatible token on the Solana ecosystem. We reserve the right to migrate the Solana compatible-based SOLCH (the “Pre-existing Tokens”) to another protocol and to generate replacement Tokens on the new protocol (the “Replacement Tokens”) in the future, should we determine, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary or useful to the operation of our Ecosystem. <br /><br />
                    Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we may no longer provide support for the Pre- existing Tokens relating to the Ecosystem, the Services, or any other operational matters, except with respect to the migration process. Although SOLCH does not at this time anticipate that it will require any Pre-existing Token holders to convert their Pre-existing Tokens to Replacement Tokens, SOLCH anticipates there will be significant incentives for Pre-existing Token owners to do so, since the practical utility of Pre-existing Tokens will likely diminish rapidly once the Replacement Tokens are created and in use by a significant portion of Ecosystem participants. Accordingly, by accepting these T&Cs you acknowledge and agree that in order for you to continue to participate on the Ecosystem or obtain utility from the Tokens you may need to convert the Tokens you purchase during the Token Sale to Replacement Tokens in the future. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">6 - Taxation</p>
                <p>
                    Any amounts that you pay for SOLCH are exclusive of all applicable taxes. You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your purchase of SOLCH, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes. It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. We are not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or similar tax arising from your purchase of SOLCH. However, in case we are obliged to withhold tax, this will be shown separately in our invoice.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white pt-4">7 - Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risks</p>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with purchasing, owning, and using SOLCH for the provision or receipt of Services on the Ecosystem, as disclosed and explained. <span className="font-bold text-white text-opacity-95 uppercase">BY PURCHASING TOKENS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THESE RISKS.</span>

                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white pt-4">Annex 1: Risk Factors </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risk of Losing Access. Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or personal Error</p>
                <p>
                    A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of SOLCH stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing SOLCH will result in loss of such SOLCH. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your SOLCH. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store SOLCH, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your SOLCH. Additionally, your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth for buying and receiving SOLCH, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect SOLCH Receipt Address, or provide an address that is not Solana compatible, may result in the loss of your SOLCH. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Relating to Solana Blockchain Protocol</p>
                <p>
                    Because Tokens and the Ecosystem are partially based on the Solana blockchain protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Solana blockchain protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Ecosystem or SOLCH. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the SOLCH and the Ecosystem, including the utility of the SOLCH for obtaining Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Solana blockchain protocol. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Mining Attacks</p>
                <p>
                    As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Solana blockchain, the Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Solana blockchain, including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ecosystem and the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Hacking. Security Issues</p>
                <p>
                    Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Ecosystem or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ecosystem is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the SOLCH team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Ecosystem, which could negatively affect the Ecosystem and the Tokens, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Hacking. Security Issues</p>
                <p>
                    Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Ecosystem or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ecosystem is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the SOLCH team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Ecosystem, which could negatively affect the Ecosystem and the Tokens, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services.
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Theft</p>
                <p>
                    SOLCH will make every effort to ensure that the cryptocurrency funds received from the Token Offering will be securely held in the Escrow Wallet. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Website, in the smart contracts on which the Escrow Wallet and the Token Offering rely, on the Solana blockchain or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the Token Offering is completed, SOLCH may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and may not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the Ecosystem. As such, distributed SOLCH may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens</p>
                <p>
                    The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Ecosystem and SOLCH will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any Tokens you own. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Future Sales. Issuance of Token</p>
                <p>
                    Future sales or issuance of SOLCH could materially and adversely affect the market price of SOLCH. Any future sale or issuance of SOLCH would increase the supply of SOLCH in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on SOLCH. The sale or distribution of a significant number of SOLCH outside of the Token Offering (including but not limited to the sales of SOLCH undertaken after the Token Offering, issuance of SOLCH to persons other than Participants for purposes of community initiatives, business development, education and market expansion and issuance of SOLCH as a reward to users of the Ecosystem), or the perception that such further sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Uninsured Losses</p>
                <p>
                    Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or any private insurance arranged by SOLCH, to offer recourse to you. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</p>
                <p>
                    The regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Ecosystem and the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Ecosystem and the Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Ecosystem and the Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of the Tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that the Tokens are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. SOLCH may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Arising from Taxation</p>
                <p>
                    The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Competing Ecosystems</p>
                <p>
                    It is possible that alternative Ecosystems could be established that utilize similar protocols underlying the Ecosystem and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The Ecosystem may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Ecosystem and Tokens, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Insufficient Interest in the Ecosystem</p>
                <p>
                    It is possible that the Ecosystem will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed Ecosystems (such as the Ecosystem) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Ecosystem and therefore the potential utility of the Tokens, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Ecosystem</p>
                <p>
                    The Ecosystem is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Tokens and Ecosystem to function as described in the Whitepaper and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to any timelines announced in the Whitepaper, on the Website or any other official channel of SOLCH, or the specifications of the Tokens or Ecosystem for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that the Tokens or Ecosystem, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risk of Dissolution of SOLCH or the Ecosystem</p>
                <p>
                    It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of BTC, ETH, (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility (including their utility for obtaining Services), the failure of commercial relationships, intellectual property ownership challenges, insolvency, or the liquidation of SOLCH, the Ecosystem may no longer be viable to operate. The Participants may lose parts or all of their SOLCH purchasing price. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</p>
                <p>
                    Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Ecosystem or SOLCH, all decisions involving SOLCH’s products or services within the Ecosystem or SOLCH itself will be made by SOLCH at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or services, to create and sell more Tokens for use on the Ecosystem, or to sell or liquidate SOLCH. These decisions could adversely affect the Ecosystem and the utility of any Tokens you own, including their utility for obtaining Services. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Relating to the Business Partners</p>
                <p>
                    Especially at the start, SOLCH relies on business partners to provide certain Services, especially for Services that require licenses as financial service institutions. While we have legally-binding agreements with business partners and are already in talks with further potential partners, we cannot guarantee that business partners won’t terminate their cooperation for whatever reason or that we can close new agreements with potential partners. The provision of certain Services might therefore be interrupted, delayed or cannot be offered at all. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks Associated with Markets for SOLCH</p>
                <p>
                    The SOLCH token is intended to be used solely on the Ecosystem, and SOLCH will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of SOLCH. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using SOLCH to obtain Services or access the Ecosystem, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to SOLCH you hold. Even if secondary trading of SOLCH is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to SOLCH (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Data Centre Facilities of Third Parties</p>
                <p>
                    SOLCH’s infrastructure is established through servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If SOLCH is unable to renew its data facility lease under commercially reasonable terms or at all, SOLCH may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third-party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, SOLCH and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any such security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon SOLCH’s infrastructure network and/or the Ecosystem may adversely impact the price of SOLCH. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Risks of Economic Conditions</p>
                <p>
                    SOLCH has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on SOLCH’s business, operations and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, SOLCH may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the Ecosystem. Suppliers on which SOLCH relies for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on SOLCH’s operations or expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on SolanaCash’s business, financial condition and results of operations and hence the Ecosystem, which would correspondingly impact the trading price of SOLCH. 
                </p>
                <p className="font-bold text-lg text-white">Unanticipated Risks</p>
                <p>
                    Cryptographic tokens such as SOLCH are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Annex. there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession, and use of the Tokens, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Annex.
